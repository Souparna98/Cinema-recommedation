# Cinema Recommendation System Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design of the Cinema Recommendation System, which utilizes collaborative filtering to recommend movies to users based on their ratings.

## Components
- **Data Collection**: The system uses the MovieLens dataset for user ratings.
- **Model**: A collaborative filtering model implemented using the SVD algorithm from the Surprise library.
- **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using RMSE to assess its performance.

## Data Flow
1. **Data Ingestion**: Load raw data from CSV files.
2. **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocess the data for model training.
3. **Model Training**: Train the model using the processed data.
4. **Prediction**: Generate movie recommendations for users.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement content-based filtering.
- Add user feedback mechanisms.
- Explore deep learning approaches for recommendations.
